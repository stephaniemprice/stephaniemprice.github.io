<h2>Welcome!</h2><br>
<h4><img src="img/SPrice_Photo.jpg" style="max-height: 350px"></h4><p>
Welcome to my homepage! I am a college senior that will be graduating in May 2019. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. <p> Even when I was young, people would remark, "Why, she asks so many questions!". Years later, my curiousity has only increased: I decided to become a scientist, after all! <p> I am a dedicated life-long learner always asking questions and seeking answers. Within science, I am interested in analytical chemistry, instrumentation, and data analysis. Additionally, I am passionate about learning about other cultures and have studied abroad three times to better enhance my world-view. I am currently seeking a company that shares my values of continual self-improvement and growth for full-time placement. <p>
