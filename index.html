<h2>Welcome!</h2><br>
Welcome to my homepage! I am a junior pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in biochemistry at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. <p> Even when I was young, people would remark, "Why, she asks so many questions!". Years later, my curiousity has only increased; I decided to become a scientist, after all! <p> I am a dedicated life-long learner always asking questions and seeking answers. Within science, I am interested in protein chemistry, analytical chemistry, and bioinformatics. Additionally, I am passionate about learning about other cultures and have studied abroad twice to better enhance my worldview. I am currently seeking a company that shares my values of continual self-improvement and growth for an internship in summer 2018. <p>
To learn more about my coursework, click the "Education" tab; about the research I have accomplished and technical skills I possess, click the "Experience" tab; about my extra-curricular activites, click the "Leadership" tab; about grants, awards, and scholarships I have earned, click the 'Awards' tab. You can also learn more about me by visiting my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-price-173293106/">LinkedIn</a>.
