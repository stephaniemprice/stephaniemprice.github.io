<h5>Student Ambassador</h5>
<b>College of Agriculture</b> | August 2016 - August 2018<br>
I represent the College of Agriculture during interactions with prospective students and industry. For prospective students, I lead personalized campus tours, perform presentations about my college experience, and mail individualized thank-you notes. Additionally, I engage with industry representatives like Land O' Lakes through luncheons and through volunteer service at College of Agriculture career fairs and professional service days for Purdue Extension Staff.

<h5>Peer Mentor </h5>
<b>Honors College</b> | August - October 2016 and 2017 <br>
As a Mentor for first-year Honors College students, I was responsible for engaging with a group of eight freshman honors students for their 8-week-long seminar HONR 19901 course. In this role, I communicated course needs from the professor to the students and facilitated development of effective leadership, teamwork, and project-completion skills.

<h5>Administrative Director</h5>
<b>Residence Hall Association (RHA) </b>| August - December 2016 <br>
I served as a liaison between the needs of Purdue’s on-campus residential community and the faculty at Purdue to have their needs met and to coordinate cooperation among Purdue’s 16 residence halls. As Administrator, I specifically managed $30,000 of club funds and collected $26,000 in club dues each fall. Additionally, I recorded meeting minutes, managed the contact information of RHA campus representatives, volunteered at campus events such as Purdue University Dance Marathon, and coordinated the application and interview process for prospective members of RHA’s executive board.
<p>
<h5>Secretary</h5>
<b>Biochemistry Club</b> | August - December 2016 </br>
As secretary, I designed advertisements for the club and composed and delivered club announcements. I managed bake sales to fund science supplies for surrounding schools and volunteered at community science outreach events such as STEM Night at Edgelea Elementary School, Celebrate Science Indiana, Spring Fest, and the Lafayette Regional Science and Engineering Fair. I contacted prospective students and answered questions that they had.
<p>
<h5>Biochemistry Buddy </h5>
<b>Department of Biochemistry</b> | August 2016 - present </br>
I was a personal mentor to a freshman biochemistry student to provide support and guidance to adjusting to Purdue and managing the first semester of the biochemistry program. 
<p>
<h5>Executive Board: Residence Hall Association Representative </h5>
<b>Shreve Club of Shreve Residence Hall </b>| August 2015 - May 2016 </br>
As the RHA representative, I represented the 864 residents of Shreve Hall through my voting decisions of the $30,000 RHA budget and communicated campus events and concerns between RHA and Shreve residents.
<p>
<h5>Cultural Companion</h5>
